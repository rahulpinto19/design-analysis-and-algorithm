DAA  is one of the most important concept.Being a computer 
science student we need to understand the algorithms of the
different problems and also the complexities of them .
What are the approaches of it to solve a problem, by learning this algo's we will
be able to create more and more algorithms and contribute to the society with  
more optimal solutions
